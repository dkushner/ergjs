  "body": "### What is it?\r\n`ergjs` is a library that makes it easy to interact with Web Workers in your site. It removes the hassle of integrating Web Workers for specific applications by managing individual, or groups of web workers as general \"task do-ers.\" \r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nTo use `ergjs` in your project, simply install via bower using:\r\n```\r\nbower install ergjs\r\n```\r\nAnd include the relevant script tag in your document:\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"/bower_components/ergjs/lib/erg.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n```javascript\r\nconst erg = new Erg();\r\n\r\nconst heavyTask = (data) => { ... };\r\nconst hugeData = [ ... ];\r\n\r\nerg.dispatch(heavyTask, heavyData).then((result) => { ... });\r\n```\r\nIt's that easy! Now your task can crunch serious data in the background while your UI renders like buttah. ",
